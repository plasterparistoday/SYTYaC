<h1>So You Think Your a Christian?</h1>

There are a great number of people that consider themselves Christian or should I say there are a great number of people that will tell you they are Christian but are they? 

<b><i>I will also point out that there will be people that will find all kinds of fault with these articles but my argument is this, read the passages that I list yourself and make up your own mind.</i></b>

Lets start with the obvious, the name "Christian". With out getting to deep, the word "Christian" has its origins in the Greek term "Χριστιανός" (Christianos), which means "follower of Christ." What does it say about someone that considers themselves a Christian but does not know a single parable taught by Jesus Christ? What does it say about someone that considers themselves a Christian but cannot recall a single one of his teachings? I have met a number of people that can quote old testament passages but when it comes to the actual teachings of Jesus Christ they are left speechless. <p>

I am reminded of a particular experience where I met a man and we struck up a conversation. He was very sure of himself about a number of topics including Christianity and government. At one point, after a fair amount of what I would call lecturing, he asked me if I knew anything about the Bible. I responded with, "how about, <b><i>Matthew 22:21: ...Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's...".</i></b> He got visibly upset and shouted "lies", "lies", "lies". I am sure that he knew a fair number of Bible passages but I would guess that most of them would have been from the old testament. <p>

The old testament is important but is it as important as the direct teachings of Jesus Christ? Is there some way that this can be settled? Lets start with the following: Many scholars refer to the Old Testament as the Hebrew Bible. This is because most of it was originally written in Hebrew, and it is the sacred text of Judaism. <p>

The Old Testament is referred to as the Tanakh. The Tanakh is an acronym that stands for the three main sections of the Jewish scriptures:<p>

Torah (תורה) – Also called the "Law" or "Teaching," this includes the first five books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These are the foundational texts that contain the laws and stories of creation, the patriarchs, and the journey of the Israelites.<p>

Nevi'im (נביאים) – This means "Prophets" and includes books about the history of Israel and the messages of the prophets, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, along with the twelve "Minor Prophets" (like Amos and Hosea).<p>

Ketuvim (כתובים) – This means "Writings" and is a collection of various books, including poetry (like Psalms), wisdom literature (like Proverbs), and stories (like Job, Ruth, and Esther).<p>

That is not to say that Jesus thought they were unimportant because he clearly thought they were important. Jesus often quoted from the Old Testament, indicating that he viewed it as authoritative scripture. For instance, in Matthew 5:17, He said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”</i></b> That last bit is important, what does the word fulfill mean to you? To me it means to complete to satisfy. That makes a lot of sense when you consider that the Torah is called the "Law". So if Jesus fulfilled the law what's left? I think it is clear the teachings of Jesus Christ. <p>

Just to make sure this is clear, lets take a look at <b><i>John 14:6: "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." </i></b><p>

Did Jesus talk about the law? Well, I am glad that you asked. The following should make things clear. <p>

<b><i>Matthew 5:21-30 21 “You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder,[a] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ 22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister[b][c] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’[d] is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell. 23 “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.</i></b>

<h2>Love</h2>

I think that we have at least laid the ground work for the obvious conclusion, that if you are a Christian you should start with Jesus Christ and end with Jesus Christ. You should know the life and teachings of the namesake of Christians, Jesus Christ. So what are some of these teachings? Lets start with these: <p>

Love God (Matthew 22:37-38): <b><i>Jesus said, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.”</i></b><p>

Love Your Neighbor (Matthew 22:39): <b><i>He continued, “And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’” </i></b><p>

Now you may be wondering, who is my neighbor? I think one of Jesus's most well-known teachings can help: The Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). I am going to include it in its entirety.<p>

<b><i>29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30 In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ 36 “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” 37 The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”</i></b><p>

I have heard people that consider themselves Christians advocate violence. How could a Christian advocate violence after reading Matthew 22:37-39? Just in case you still don't think that is enough what did Jesus say about violence?  <p>

Turn the Other Cheek (Matthew 5:39): <b><i>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also." </i></b><p>

Some times people need a little more convincing when it comes to Jesus's conviction about love. Some people argue about who their neighbor is but it is hard to argue when it comes to the term "enemy".<p>

Love Your Enemies (Matthew 5:43-44, Luke 6:27-28): Jesus instructed his followers to love not only their friends but also their enemies, which is a radical expansion of the tradition.<p>

The New Commandment (John 13:34-35): Jesus told his disciples, <b><i>“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.”</i></b><p>

Love and Sacrifice (John 15:13): Jesus said, <b><i>“Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” This teaching connects love to self-sacrifice.</i></b><p>

<h2>Repentance</h2>

We touched on this in the previous article, the fact that none of us are perfect. I hear that used as a defense or even an excuse when it should be a call to action: (Luke 13:3, 5) Jesus said, “Unless you repent, you too will all perish.” The parable of the Prodigal Son should give us a clue about repentance. <p>

Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32): In this parable, Jesus told the story of a wayward son who squandered his inheritance but was welcomed back with open arms by his father when he returned home in repentance. <p>

But what does it mean to repent? Can I just attend church next Sunday and all will be forgiven and forgotten? Here we can go to the old testament for an explanation. <p>

<b><i>Ezekiel 18:30-31: “Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.”</i></b><p>
<b><i>Matthew 3:8: “Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.” </i></b><p>

In other words if you think that all you have to do is tell someone that you are a Christian and attend church on Sunday you are mistaken. Christianity is a way of life not a hobby and to drive that statement home how's this? <p>

<b><i>James 2:14-17 (NIV):
"What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."</i></b>

<h2>Hypocrisy</h2>

Of course we should not judge but we should be vigilant and thoughtful about people that call themselves Christian leaders. Should you follow someone that loudly in full view of a camera states that they are a Christian? What about the belief that a leader should be wealthy, that God has blessed that person with riches so we should consider them a leader. <p>

Lets start with the last first (see what I did there?). <p>

<b><i>Matthew 19:23-24:
“Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.’”</i></b><p>

I don't know about you but I have seen plenty of camels in zoos but I have never seen one go through the eye of a needle. Now for something a little more direct.<p>

<b><i>Luke 12:15:
“Then he said to them, ‘Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.’”</i></b><p>

<b><i>1 Timothy 6:17-18:
“Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.”</i></b><p>

And another parable. <p>

<b><i>Luke 16:19-25:
In this parable, the rich man lives in luxury while Lazarus suffers in poverty at his gate. After death, the rich man suffers in torment, while Lazarus is comforted in paradise. </i></b><p>

<b><i>Matthew 6:5-6 (NIV):
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."</i></b><p>

Does this mean that you should not profess your faith and praise the Lord, no of course not. Matthew 6:5-6 is telling you something you already know and that is that there are people that will attempt to use Christianity to further their goals, these are people you should avoid. The Bible has a lot to say about hypocrisy.<p>

<b><i>Matthew 23:25-26:
“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.”</i></b><p>

<b><i>Matthew 6:1-2:
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.”</i></b><p>

Does this mean that we should judge these people, no of course not. <p>

<b><i>Matthew 7:3-5:
“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.”</i></b><p>


<h2>Pharisees and Sadducees</h2>

Jesus had a lot to say about the Pharisees and Sadducees but who were they? 


The Pharisees emerged as a significant group in Jewish society around the time of the Maccabean Revolt, their beliefs centered around the Oral Law, which they held to be as authoritative as the written Torah (the first five books of the Bible). A comparison could be made to groups today that prioritize strict traditionalism, literal interpretations, or legalistic approaches to their faith, movements that stress adherence to long-standing doctrines or rituals, at the expense of the teachings of Jesus Christ.

The Sadducees were primarily associated with the priestly aristocracy and emerged around the same time as the Pharisees. They held a more conservative view of scripture, adhering strictly to the written Torah and rejecting any additional oral traditions. The Sadducees seem to resemble individuals or groups today that hold both religious and political influence, often aligning with political power to preserve certain privileges or status. A comparison is possible to individuals and groups that prioritize political alliances, wealth, or status, at the cost of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It can be said that they compromised on principles to maintain influence.

What did Jesus have to say about the Pharisees and Sadducees? 

<b><i>Matthew 23:1-4 (read all of Matthew 23 it is worth it):
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: 2 “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. 3 So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. 4 They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.</i></b><p>

<b><i>Matthew 23:33
“You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?</i></b><p>

I think you get the idea. Be careful who you follow and revere. I will end with another parable. 

<b><i>Luke 18:9-14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ 13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</i></b><p>
